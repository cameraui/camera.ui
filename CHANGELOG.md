# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **Default settings page could point to a page that doesn't exist.** The "default settings page" option under Settings > Appearance listed an "Instances" entry that has no matching page (selecting it led to a dead route) and was missing "Notifications". The list now matches the actual settings pages, and any previously saved invalid choice falls back to Account.
- **Interface language detection.** Regional system locales now resolve to their base language (e.g. `de-AT` and `de-CH` map to German), and any unsupported system language falls back to English.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **Plugin installs failed in the desktop app.** Installing or updating a plugin tried to launch a system `npm`, which the desktop app doesn't ship, so it failed with `spawn npm ENOENT`. The desktop app now uses its own bundled npm to install plugin dependencies.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Custom ffmpeg path.** A new optional `ffmpegPath` config setting points camera.ui at a specific ffmpeg binary. When set and the file exists it takes precedence over the bundled one; otherwise the bundled ffmpeg (recommended) or system `ffmpeg` is used.

### Fixed

- **Snapshots and streams could fail with `ffmpeg: executable file not found`.** When the bundled ffmpeg wasn't detected at first launch, go2rtc's ffmpeg path fell back to a bare `ffmpeg` and stayed there even once the bundled binary became available. The path now re-points to the bundled ffmpeg on every start.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Bind address option.** A new `host` config setting controls which address the server listens on (default `::`), so you can bind to a specific interface or to `127.0.0.1` behind a reverse proxy.
- **Release notes before updating.** The server update dialog now shows the release notes for the target version, so you can see what changed before you confirm.

### Fixed

- **Server wouldn't start with IPv6 disabled.** Binding to the IPv6 wildcard (`::`) now falls back to IPv4 (`0.0.0.0`) when IPv6 is turned off at the kernel level.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-06

camera.ui v2 is a **complete rewrite** — a new server, a new interface, and a new architecture. Listing every change here wouldn't do it justice; instead:

- **What camera.ui is now:** see the [documentation](https://docs.cameraui.com)
- **Coming from v1?** v2 is a fresh start — please read [Getting started](https://docs.cameraui.com/intro/getting-started)

Changes after this release will be documented here as usual.
